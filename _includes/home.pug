    p.main-par Eugene Delta plays a lonely violin into the shore’s doleful sunset. Calling upon a flood of electro-elegiac waves. An ocean is melancholia. A beat is a whirlwind. Eugene Delta’s voice is a ship, fragile but never broken, guiding courageously through storm and maelstrom. On stage a microphone. Guitar, violin, drums. Joined by several synthesizers. Enjoy!

        p Eugene Delta manages to interweave elements of acoustics and electronica with ease. I’ve rarely ever heard something like that. I think the songwriting is fantastic and the voice beautiful.

        p The band’s secret weapon, I have to say, would be Emanuel Donner on violin, percussions and heart-rending backing vocals. Watching him means witnessing sheet music transform into electricity, means getting to see what power and impact feel like, without just turning knobs on an amp.
